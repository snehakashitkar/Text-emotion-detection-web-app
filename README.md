#Welcome to the Text Emotion Detection Web App
This app uses a machine learning model to detect emotions from text input. Use the Emotion Detection page to analyze the emotions in your text. Learn more about the project on the About page.


This app is a text emotion detection tool built using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes input text and predicts the emotion, along with the confidence score for each emotion. It uses a pre-trained Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier with a pipeline of text processing steps.

Research on Text Emotion Detection
This research focuses on using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and categorize emotions expressed in text. The importance of understanding emotional nuances in textual data is crucial in various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability in emotion detection.
